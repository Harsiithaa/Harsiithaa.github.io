On a not so fine hot summer morning I wanted to dual boot my windows laptop with ubuntu because..why not??.Is installing ubuntu is such a huge task ? nope but i made it difficult with my unpreparedness . So i want you guys to know the mistakes i did during installation so that you  can have smooth installation. Sounds awesome right ? okay lets dive into my ubuntu installation experience. When i decided to install ubuntu i had two options that i can dual boot or replace windows completely with ubuntu. Come on, Its a short life to make adventures hence i went with option one. Then i immediately started to organize my files on pc which were piled up since i brought this laptop(my first year).I think it is easy to walk on water than organizing and deleting unwanted files . It took me almost 2 days to clear and organize files on my pc. But the war is not over yet : )..now the most important task is to back up imp files.Yeah i know backing up files can be tiresome and boring . But installing new os can be tricky sometimes as it can erase existing files. I backed up my files and completed the first level of installation.

Now i searched ubuntu installation tutorial and selected this :
I followed every step in the tutorial. As a part of next step we need an empty usb then i realised that my usb is full of files . I deleted all files in my pendrive and inserted to my pc. Ironically  my pendrive is not detected. I tried many times but all attempts went to vain. Then i checked whether it is detecting on other pc .Yes, it is detected on other pc. But whats the point ?? when i have to install ubuntu on MY laptop. So i formatted my pendrive in other pc and tested my luck again . When i inserted in my laptop it was detected !!! gif:(yayy)

We have to install ubuntu in pendrive using rufus. Which i done perfectly .Its all going well until i mistakenly assigned less space for ubuntu partition. I gave 30 gb for a new os and  the worse thing is i didn't even realize it is less. Now when i restart my pc it is not showing ubuntu and I've come full circle back to where I started. Its a mess again!!. I tried to shrink Disk space again .It is not working then i came to know GParted  an official GNOME partition-editing application.I downloaded it again with my all cleverness i installed gparted in my pendrive.(gif:head hands)
 Its time to format again!!.After formatting my pendrive i wanted to try again to install ubuntu and re-started my laptop.  Ubuntu appeared on my screen !!Unexpected things happens when we least expect them .So opened it, followed as it is in the tutorial.Then i came across a new term "bit locker encryption".We have to turn  off bit locker encryption in windows so it allows changes for new os. I went to windows turned off it using commandline prompt.I came back to ubuntu and finally i had dualbooted my laptop.
It a rollercoaster ride but i learnt many new things, terms and got to know how to trouble shoot errors on my own which can make things more worse or fun thn they are.
Mistakes i did :
1) Giving lesss disk space
2) Not ready with empty usb
3) Installing gparted in my usb
4)Turn off bitlocker in windows before installation
Things i learned:
1) Get to know more about steps that you are following in a tutorial .In simple terms dont follow blindly without understanding
2) Got to know Gparted application
3) Can trouble shoot my own usb (jk)

Stay tuned if you  wanna about my experience with ubuntu or how my ubuntu is working with less disk space . If you enjoy this blog hit a big thumbsupp!!.
