On a not-so-fine hot summer morning, I wanted to dual-boot my Windows laptop with Ubuntu because... why not? Is installing Ubuntu such a huge task? Nope, but I made it difficult with my unpreparedness. So, I want you guys to know the mistakes I did during installation so that you can have a smooth installation. Sounds awesome, right? Okay, let's dive into my Ubuntu installation experience.

I followed every step in the tutorial. As a part of the next step, we needed an empty USB. Then I realized that my USB was full of files. I deleted all the files on my pendrive and inserted it into my PC. Ironically, my pendrive was not detected. I tried many times, but all attempts were in vain. Then I checked whether it was detected on another PC. Yes, it was detected on another PC. But what's the point when I have to install Ubuntu on MY laptop? So, I formatted my pendrive on another PC and tested my luck again. When I inserted it into my laptop, it was detected!!! gif: (yayy)

We have to install Ubuntu on a pendrive using Rufus, which I did perfectly. It's all going well until I mistakenly assigned less space for the Ubuntu partition. I gave 30 GB for the new OS, and the worst thing is I didn't even realize it was insufficient. Now, when I restart my PC, Ubuntu is not showing up and I've come full circle back to where I started. It's a mess again!! I tried to shrink the disk space again. It is not working. Then I came to know about GParted, an official GNOME partition-editing application. I downloaded it again and with all my cleverness, I installed GParted on my pendrive. (gif: facepalm)

It's time to format again!! After formatting my pendrive, I wanted to try again to install Ubuntu and restarted my laptop. Ubuntu appeared on my screen!! Unexpected things happen when we least expect them. So, I opened it and followed the tutorial as it is. Then I came across a new term, 'BitLocker encryption.' We have to turn off BitLocker encryption in Windows so it allows changes for the new OS. I went to Windows, turned it off using the command-line prompt. I came back to Ubuntu and finally, I had dual-booted my laptop.

It's a rollercoaster ride, but I learned many new things, terms, and got to know how to troubleshoot errors on my own, which can make things worse or more fun than they are.
Mistakes I made:

    1.Giving less disk space
    2.Not having an empty USB ready
    3.Installing GParted on my USB
    4.Not Turning off BitLocker in Windows before installation

Things I learned:

    1.Get to know more about the steps you are following in a tutorial. In simple terms, don't follow blindly without understanding.
    2.Got to know the GParted application.
    3.Can troubleshoot my own USB (just kidding).

Stay tuned if you want to hear about my experience with Ubuntu or how my Ubuntu is working with less disk space. </font>
